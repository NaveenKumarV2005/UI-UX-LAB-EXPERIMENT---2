 Name : Naveen Kumar V

 Reg no : 212223220068

## ALGORITHM:
## a. Applying Gestalt Principles to Vid Stream

```
i) Gestalt principles help users quickly understand content hierarchy in a streaming interface.
ii) Proximity: Group movie title, genre, and play button inside the same movie card so users recognize related actions instantly.
iii) Similarity: Keep all movie cards with the same shape, shadow, and hover effect to maintain visual consistency.
iv) Common Region: Place categories like “Trending Now” and “Top Picks” inside horizontal carousel sections to clearly separate content groups.
v) Figure–Ground: Use dark background with bright posters so content stands out clearly.
```

## b. Incorporating UI Elements & Design Patterns
```
i) Use familiar OTT patterns so users instantly know how to navigate.
ii) Hero Banner: Large featured movie section at top with Play button overlay.
iii) Card UI: Rounded movie cards with hover zoom animation for desktop and swipe gesture for mobile.
iv) Sticky Navbar: Include Logo, Home, Movies, Series, My List, Profile Avatar.
v) Search Bar Pattern: Expandable search input with icon animation.
vi) Progress Loader: Skeleton loading cards while content loads.
```
## c. Interaction Behaviors & Usability Principles
```
i) Focus on smooth navigation and minimal cognitive load.
ii) Fitts’s Law: Make Play, Add to List, and Login buttons large and easy to tap.
iii) Hover & Micro-Interactions: Movie cards slightly scale on hover with glow effect.
iv) Visibility of System Status: Show loading animation when content is buffering or page is transitioning.
v) Minimalism: Keep only one main action in hero section (Play Now) to avoid clutter.
vi) Smart Animate Transitions: Smooth fade/slide animations between Login, Home, and Movie Details pages.
```
## d. Branding: Creating a Logo in Canva (Vid Stream)
```
i) Iconography: Combine a Play Button triangle with a streaming wave or film strip symbol.
ii) Color Palette:
Primary: Cinematic Red (#E50914) or Deep Crimson
Secondary: Black / Dark Grey background
Accent: White for contrast
